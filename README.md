I installed Nmap and scanned our device using the IPv4 address from the Ethernet adapter.  
The scan identified open/filtered/closed ports and exported the results as an HTML report.

# Steps
1. Found the IPv4 address (Ethernet adapter).
2. Ran Nmap scan on that IP.
3. Interpreted results:
   - Green → safe ports
   - Yellow → need review
   - Red → unsafe ports
4. Saved scan report as .html for documentation.

# Tools
1. Nmap
